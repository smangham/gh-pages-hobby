You can have some of it if you want.

## What

I'm **Toaster**/**Talkie Toaster**/**theTalkieToaster** depending on how soon I got to whatever platform†, and I make videogame mods and TTRPG splats.

In real life I'm a research software engineer.
Modding is surprisingly a lot like working with janky, decade-old academic codes.

## Projects

### Videogame Mods

My mods are generally code-based, with a sprinkling of Programmer Art.

* Bethesda Softworks games
    * [Oblivion](https://www.nexusmods.com/profile/TheTalkieToaster/mods?gameId=101)

### Tabletop RPG Content

My RPG content is generally variant mechanics or rules tweaks, with a sprinking of kitbashing stuff (so basically the same).

* [FFG Star Wars RPG](ttrpg/swrpg)
* [Lancer](ttrpg/lancer)

## FAQ

> "Can I commission you to..."

No. I don't need the money and I have enough ideas of my own.

> "Would you like to collaborate on..."

No. I mean, *conceptually*, yeah, but my health is, uh, not great. Also I have ADHD.
So it's just not practical, I'll either get sick or wander off chasing a cloud.

> "Can I add you on..."

I don't know you, though?

† I picked the name after the Talkie Toaster from Red Dwarf, probably in the late 90s? Back when we didn't realise how important usernames actually *were*. Haven't actually watched Red Dwarf since I was a teen, it was OK.
